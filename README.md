# Western Workshop - Using Google Maps API

Simple vanilla web application leveraging the core Google Maps API.

Leverages Google Maps API to render an interactive local map, with a specific zone highlighted, and a field where you can enter an address and determine whether or not that address is within the highlighted zone.

In our workshops, we'll be building out an imaginary app for our new startup - Earth Defense - a company dedicated to the protection of earth from falling rocks and other space-based existential threats!

We'll be using the Google Maps API to render a heatmap of recorded asteroid collision points around earth, leveraging an online data-source from [NASA's Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/ak9y-cwf9)
